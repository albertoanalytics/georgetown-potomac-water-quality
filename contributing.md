# Contributing to Georgetown Potomac: Satellite Water Quality Parameter Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Georgetown Potomac water quality analysis project.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project:

1. **Data Analysis Extensions**: Develop additional analysis techniques for the existing data
2. **Temporal Expansion**: Extend the analysis to include additional years
3. **Spatial Expansion**: Apply the methodology to other sections of the Potomac River
4. **Methodology Refinements**: Improve the water quality parameter calculations
5. **Visualization Enhancements**: Create better visualizations of the data
6. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance explanation of methods or results
7. **Bug Fixes**: Fix any issues in the existing code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To contribute to this project, you'll need:

1. A Google Earth Engine account (free for research and non-commercial use)
2. Basic knowledge of JavaScript programming
3. Understanding of remote sensing principles
4. (Optional) GIS software for working with the spatial data

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. For Google Earth Engine code:
   - Import the JavaScript files into your GEE account
   - The main script is `potomac-analysis.js`
3. For data analysis:
   - The CSV files can be opened with spreadsheet software or data analysis tools

## Contribution Process

### For Minor Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the improvements

### For Major Changes

1. Open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a new branch for your feature
4. Implement your changes
5. Submit a pull request referencing the original issue

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript (Earth Engine)

1. Use clear variable names that reflect their purpose
2. Include comments explaining complex calculations
3. Break long functions into smaller, more manageable pieces
4. Follow the existing formatting style

### Documentation

1. Use Markdown for all documentation files
2. Include examples where appropriate
3. Keep explanations clear and concise
4. Update documentation when changing functionality

## Testing

Before submitting your changes:

1. Test Earth Engine scripts by running them in the GEE environment
2. Ensure all tasks execute without errors
3. Verify that outputs (maps, charts, exports) display correctly
4. Check that performance remains reasonable (processing time, memory usage)

## Data Contributions

If you're contributing additional data:

1. Document the source clearly
2. Describe any processing steps applied
3. Explain how the data complements the existing analysis
4. Provide sample visualizations if applicable

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

1. A clear description of the problem
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Screenshots if applicable
5. Any error messages received

## Additional Resources

For questions about the project methodology or satellite remote sensing:

- Refer to the `methodology.md` file for detailed information
- Check the references section in the README
- Contact the repository maintainer with specific questions

## Code of Conduct

Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

1. Be respectful of other contributors
2. Use inclusive language
3. Accept constructive criticism gracefully
4. Focus on the quality of the science and code

Thank you for helping improve my understanding of the Potomac River's water quality through remote sensing!
